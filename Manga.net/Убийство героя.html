       <h1>Description:</h1>
       <h2>This world was not merciful, and I responded with the same sincere hatred. When it became the Game, nothing changed for me. However, meeting Li Se-Chung - a hero, a Warrior, a member of the most revered of the guilds - gave me a home, comrades and the meaning of life. The point was to destroy those damn dungeons and end the Game! I died from a sword in the back. From the sword of the one whom I believed, at the gates of the last dungeon ... Now I have returned and I know exactly who will be the prey of the "<em>hunting dog</em>" <strong>Kim Woo Jin</strong>, no matter what it takes!</h2>
